# Question 1: What is Morse Code

Morse code is an encoding method for transmitting characters over a wired or wireless communications system. It encodes alpha numeric characters as a series of sequences of signals of two different
durations called a 'DIT' and a 'DAH', where the 'DAH' signal is 3 times longer induration than the 'DIT'. 
The length of sequences are based upon the frequency of occurance of the letter to be encoded such
that the more frequent letters have the shortest sequences.

# Question 2: Who developed Morse Code

Morse code was invented by Sammuel Morse for communication using the Telegraph.
