# Embedded Device Example

For my example of an embedded device I chose the home Microwave oven.  This device utilizes an embedded system to control the 
cooking of food. Typical Microwave ovens provide a simple led display and touch pad interface allow for the creation of basic
to complex cooking cycles as well. The embedded system is responsible for turning cooking instructions in to control signals
which control the emission of microwaves to heat food.  It also controls a motor which rotates the food for even cooking.

## Design challenges

Cost 
: As most microwaves are consumer oriented, they need to be affordable. Component prices are critical.

Memory
: Memory space is limited but the system needs to provide potentially complex features.

Reliability
: The embedded system must be reliable and is expected to last many years.

Testability
: A microwave typically limited or no access for test equipment connections. 

Troubleshooting
: Limited UI presents mimimal diagnostic information and capability. 

Component Availability
: Due to current global logistical issues, compoents required for the embedded system may be in limited supply.
